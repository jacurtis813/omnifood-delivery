123. Use a style for the columns in a way that instead of the columns breaking down into equal parts such 3 containers equally built and spaces on the page, we can use the columns selector for three. however, we can build one column in a way that one column will build into one unit and one column will build into two units making total of those three units/ columns
124. Using the elements that are to build the form for this section. form element, label element and the input element. input element is self closing

135. Create another div within the footer to begin building an area for the copyrights of the page that will be embedded
136. Next portion of the build we will align the footer nav and the social nav  navigations, we will remove the bullets and the border that has been pre assigned with the property that we have reused

143. We have only built the web page based on the fluid grid system, which means that our web page is not entirely responsive
144. Next section we will begin to make the site responsive among all devices even the smart phones and tablets

145. Using media queries and breakpoints for specific devices, create a new file calling the media queries for the styling and resizing of the web page for all different sizes
146. Begin structuring our css file for the mediaqueries, we will use these points that we have created as the main breakpoints for each device 
147. Start with setting the meta tag within the head element of the page, we will then give and fill the attributes needed to make the webpage responsive
148. We will begin creating the mediaqueries that are needed for the pages breakpoints, resize the page to see when the element began to break or look unpleasant

149. Create the styles for the breakpoints in the webpage between 1200-1024px, set those styles and test the code for those screen sizes. They are working great
150. Begin creating the styles for the breakpoints in the web page between 1023-768px, set those styles and test each section of code that we are adjusting using the same technique of media queries. style a good section of the page in lecture one, continue on to the second lecture to complete
151. Continue breaking the page to find the elements that need to be adjusted within our media queries css file, start with the steps section or the how it works section, removing some white space and resizing the image

155. Copy and paste the property and value from the col class and create the style that we wish to have for the margin within that mediaque, thise giving us the correct spacing within the pricing box content, responsive web design- this will inherit with all the elements that hold the col class
156. Complete the styles for the last two sections on my own, 767-481px and 480-0px designed by myself. Completed

157. After creating the media queries for our breakpoints within the web page we are moving into the next section of using javascript files and our own js file within our page
158. We will begin by finding all the files that we need for this project, properly linking them in the body element of the html file this allowing the scripts to be calle on after the web page has rendered
159. Create our own script.js file that we will begin to both learn how to format and understand how to format the script file
160. Correct the formatting within all the files for the webpage, save all content test and run what code we now have embeded

161. Create our first basic line of javascript to assign within our html and css files
162. Create our link for the js file that we have created so that the script can be called on within the browser, just as we would with the css files. Attach all script files together just before the closing body element
163. Test and run our first line of javascript with jquery, within the html file to see that the function is working properly. All working as the function should
164. We will then begin creating the real world interactive js and jquery within the html file, creating what is known as the sticky navigation

165. Create the sticky navigation so that when the user scrolls beyond the header the navigation will scroll along with the user within the page
166. Begin with creating a new class within the nav element in this case we are using the main nav, create the style selector in the style.css file, use the property of position and value of fixed, after the position we must call the position in which we would like the nav to be fixed and we would like it to remain in the 'very' top left of the page when scrolling within the page
167. Once we have created the classes that we would like to be within our sticky navigation we can now begin building code in our js file now we will be styling the page to become reactive with the user, now using js and jquery
168. Test and run the code that we have now formatted within all files, html, css, and the js file that we have both created and the js files that we have linked within the body element of our page.

169. Now we will begin working with a new property in the css file called the z index which will help us with our vertical stacking within the html file of the element stacking, we used the highest possible value that way tis element is on top
170. Now we will begin making the buttons within the webpage more reactive with the user on the landing page, starting with the main buttons in our header section or the hero
171. Create the animation for the first button in the header of the hero text box for the I'm Hungry button, test and run the code that we have written for the animation for the first button
172. Create the animation for the second button in the header of the hero text box for the Show Me More button, test and run the code that we have written for the animation for the second button

173. Begin creating the animation for the navigation menu selection tabs in the header of the main, create the navigation function so that when clicking the tab the action/ function of the dropdown will happen
174. Create the function within the javascript file, copy the jquert from css tricks to call by the id selector of those tabs within the menu navigation
175. Set the ids for all the menu tabs within the main navigation header, after creating the id names we will call those by the octothorp placed before the id name within the tab or what is the list element of the ul- unordered list
176. Test and run all four of the menu tabs/ better known as the list elements within the unordered list. save and commit all changes within these files
